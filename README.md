# SIR-Epidemiological-Model-ModSimPy
An epidemiological model for the spread of an infection in a small, closed or about-closed system.


## Model description 

This is a compartmental model for the spread of an infection in a closed or about-closed (relative to the population size, the fraction of individuals joining and/ or leaving the population is very small) community.

If we let S, I, and R represent the fraction of the total population in the susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments, respectively, then the following differential equations apply to the system:

$$ \frac{dS}{dt} = \beta  $$


where $t$ is the time variable, 

## Assumptions
The fraction of individuals joining and/ or leaving the population is 0 or very small.
Time is a continuous variable.
There are no deaths nor births.
Permanent immunity is developed upon recovery.
